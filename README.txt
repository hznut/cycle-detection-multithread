This is a simple java application for detecting cycles in undirected graph.
It only gives a yes/no answer and writes the remaining graph having only 
cycles and nodes connecting the cycles (if any).

This is a work in progress. Unit Tests are being worked on.
There are bugs and I am fixing them.

How to run:
./bin/run.sh data/test_cycle_4.dat data/ <num-thread>
